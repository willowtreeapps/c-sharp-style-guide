## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow C# standards.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are all **PascalCase**, multiple words concatenated together, without hyphens ( - ) or underscores ( \_ ). Namespaces should **not** follow reverse domain conventions as is common in Java: 

**BAD**:

```csharp
com.willowtree.project.component
```

**GOOD**:

```csharp
WillowTree.Project.Component
```

### Classes & Interfaces

Written in **PascalCase**. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Enums

Names of enumeration types (also called enums) in general should follow the standard type-naming rules (PascalCasing, etc.).

Enum type names should also use a singular type.

Enum type names types should not include an "Enum", "Flag", or "Flags" suffix.

Enum values should not include a prefix that references the name of the enumeration type.

**BAD:**
```csharp
public enum Cases
{
    CaseFirst,
    CaseSecond
}
```

**GOOD:**
```csharp
public enum Case
{
    First,
    Second
}
```

### Methods

Methods are written in **PascalCase**. For example `DoSomething()`. 

### Fields and Properties

All private and internal fields (including backing fields) are written with a preceding underscore in **camelCase**.  All Properties are written in **PascalCase**. 

Fields should use explicit access modifiers (public, private) even if they are using the default access modifier.

Public and protected fields should be avoided in favor of properties.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public class MyClass 
{
    private int myPrivateVariable;
    public int publicField;
    int internalField;
}
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
public class MyClass 
{
    public int PublicField { get; set; }
    private int _packagePrivate;
    private int _myBackedProperty;
    public int MyBackedProperty
    {
        get { return _myBackedProperty; }
        set { _myBackedProperty = value; }
    }

    protected int MyProtected { get; set; }
}
```

The one exception to this is if you are working with Unity. These standards go against Unity convention, and you should feel free to ignore them in that case.

Static fields are the exception and should be written in **PascalCase**.

```csharp
public static readonly int TheAnswer = 42;
```


### Parameters

Parameters are written in **camelCase**.

**BAD:**

```csharp
void doSomething(Vector3 Location)
```
**GOOD:**

```csharp
void DoSomething(Vector3 location)
```

Single character values are to be avoided except for temporary looping variables and for EventArgs parameters.

### Delegates and EventHandlers

Delegates are written in **PascalCase**.

When declaring delegates, DO add the suffix **EventHandler** to names of delegates that are used in events. 

By converntion, .NET event handlers always take 2 parameters: a sender and an EventArgs derived class. You should follow this convention when declaring event handlers.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public delegate void Click()
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
public delegate void ClickEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
```  

DO add the suffix **Callback** to names of delegates other than those used as event handlers.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public delegate void Render()
```
**GOOD:**

```csharp
public delegate void RenderCallback()
```  

In most cases it may be better to use ***Action<T>*** or ***Func<T>*** for these over explicity declared callbacks.

### Events

Following Microsoft's naming conventions on events:
* **DO** name events with a verb or a verb phrase.
* **DO** give events names with a concept of before and after, using the present and past tenses. For example, a close event that is raised before a window is closed would be called Closing, and one that is raised after the window is closed would be called Closed.
* **DO NOT** use "Before" or "After" prefixes or postfixes to indicate pre- and post-events. Use present and past tenses as just described.
* **DO** name event argument classes with the "EventArgs" suffix
* **DO NOT** prefix events with **On**. This should be reserved for protected virtual methods used to raise events.

**BAD:**

```csharp
public event CloseCallback OnClose;
```  

**GOOD:**

```csharp
public event ClosedEventHandler Closed;
```

* **DO NOT** Use anonymous delegate to subscribe to events in Xamarin. This can cause memory leaks you are unable to unregister from the event (and the anonymous delegate strong captures 'this')
* **DO** Unsubscribe / resubscribe from events when it makes sense to avoid memory leaks
* **GENERALLY** Unless multiple subscription is required, try to avoid C# events in Xamarin.

**BAD**

```csharp
this.Closed += (sender, args) {
    if(args.IsTrue)
    {
        PerformActions(args);
    }
}
```

**GOOD**

```csharp
public override void ViewDidAppear()
{
    this.Closed += FrameClosed;
}

public override void ViewDidDisappear()
{
    this.Closed -= FrameClosed;
}
```

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

**BAD:**

```csharp
XMLHTTPRequest
String URL
findPostByID
```  

**GOOD:**

```csharp
XmlHttpRequest
String url
findPostById
```

## Declarations

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and member variables. Avoid using default visibility.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

**BAD:**

```csharp
string username, twitterHandle;
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
private string _username;
private string _twitterHandle;
```

### Implicitly Typed Local Variables

Use implicit typing for local variables when the type of the variable is obvious from the right side of the assignment, or when the compiler would not be able to correctly determine the type.

**GOOD:**
```csharp
// When the type of a variable is clear from the context, use var 
// in the declaration.
var var1 = "This is clearly a string.";
var var2 = 27;
var var3 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
```

Explicitly type the variable when the compiler would not be able to correctly determine the type, or explicitly typing would add pertinent information.

**GOOD:**
```csharp
// When the type of a variable is not clear from the context, use an
// explicit type.
int var4 = ExampleClass.ResultSoFar();
```

Do not rely on the variable name to specify the type of the variable. It might not be correct.

**BAD:**
```csharp
// Naming the following variable inputInt is misleading. 
// It is a string.
var inputInt = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine(inputInt);
```

Avoid the use of var in place of dynamic.

Use implicit typing to determine the type of the loop variable in for and foreach loops.

**GOOD:**

for Loop
```csharp
var syllable = "ha";
var laugh = "";
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    laugh += syllable;
    Console.WriteLine(laugh);
}
```

foreach Loop
```csharp
foreach (var ch in laugh)
{
    if (ch == 'h')
        Console.Write("H");
    else
        Console.Write(ch);
}
Console.WriteLine();
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where scoping appropriate.

Interfaces that have one explicit implementation (service classes for example) *may* be declared in the same file as the classes that implement them.

### Interfaces

All interfaces should be prefaced with the letter **I**. 

**BAD:**

```csharp
RadialSlider
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
IRadialSlider
```

## Spacing

### Indentation

Indentation should be done using **spaces** â€” never tabs.  

#### Blocks

Indentation for blocks uses **4 spaces** for optimal readability:

**BAD:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
    Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

#### Line Wraps

Indentation for line wraps should use **4 spaces** (not the default 8):

**BAD:**

```csharp
CoolUiWidget widget =
        someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line);
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
CoolUiWidget widget =
    someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line);
```

### Vertical Spacing

There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity 
and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but 
having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into
several methods.

## Brace Style

All braces get their own line as it is a C# convention:

**BAD:**

```csharp
class MyClass {
    void DoSomething() {
        if (someTest) {
          // ...
        } else {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    void DoSomething()
    {
        if (someTest)
        {
          // ...
        }
        else
        {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The one exception to braces on their own line is for anonymous functions, where the brace should go on the same line.

**BAD:**

```csharp
Filter( (x) 
    {
        if(x.IsComplicated)
        {
            return x > 5 + x.FirstSum;
        }

        return x < 4 + x.SecondSum;
    });
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
Filter( (x) {
        if(x.IsComplicated)
        {
            return x > 5 + x.FirstSum;
        }

        return x < 4 + x.SecondSum;
    });
```

Conditional statements are always required to be enclosed with braces, irrespective of the number of lines required.

**BAD:**

```csharp
if (someTest)
    doSomething();  

if (someTest) doSomethingElse();
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
if (someTest) 
{
    doSomething();
}  

if (someTest) { doSomethingElse(); }
```

## Switch Statements

Switch-statements come with `default` case by default (heh). When your code is written correctly, it should never reach this part.
Never include the `default` case.

**BAD:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
    default:
        break;
}
```

**GOOD:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
}
```

## Language

Use US English spelling.

**BAD:**

```csharp
string colour = "red";
```

**GOOD:**

```csharp
string color = "red";
```
